        abstract: '<p>Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to fight against the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data. To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized influenza patients and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from Columbia University Irving Medical Center9s electronic health records. We expect COHD-COVID will provide researchers and clinicians quantitative measures of COVID-19 related clinical features to better understand and fight against the pandemic.</p>',

        abstract: '<p>Since SARS-Cov-2 epidemic appeared in Wuhan China, it became challenge for health authorities to counter Covid-19 epidemic. Early evaluation of suspects, screening for Covid-19 and management posed challenge to health authorities especially in developing countries which were not ready to cope with it. Early mild symptoms appeared during course of disease provide a chance to early detect Covid-19. We use retrospective methodology to collect available data on early sign and symptoms of Covid-19 through accessing World Health Organization (WHO) webpages, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature Journal, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) network, British Medical Journal (BJM), Lancet and other world renowned journal publications to establish a relationship of early symptoms for detection of Covid-19. Data of 2707 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases was collected and analyzed for early signs. Available data was categorized into physical and blood biomarkers. This categorized data was assessed for scoring early detection of Covid-19 by scoring Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula. Each characteristic was given a score in Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 chart with maximum score of 28. Scoring 16 on chart means Covid-19 will fully develop in near future. Correlation of each sign and symptoms with development of Covid-19 in formula showed significant correlation assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho) showed significant correlation of development of Covid-19 with fever 64.11% (P=0.001), cough 65% and dry mucus 19.67% equally sensitive (P=0.000), leukopenia 19.06% (P=0.006), lymphopenia 52.93% (P=0.005), thrombopenia 19.1% (P=0.013), elevated Aspartate aminotransferase 12.79%   (P=0.007) and elevated Alanine aminotransferase 11.34% (P=0.006). Chart can sense Covid-19 progression 72-96 hours earlier compared to usual course of disease and detection by standard method. Chart for early detection provides early quarantine decision to reduce disease spread and give ample time for intervening disease progression to reduce morbidity time due to Covid-19</p>',

        abstract: '<p>Background: Long COVID or long-term complication after COVID-19 has the ability to affect health and quality of life. Knowledge about the burden and predictors could aid in their prevention and management. Most of the studies are from high-income countries and focus on severe cases. We did this study to estimate the prevalence and identify the characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among our patients. \nMethodology: We recruited adult (\u226518 years) patients who were diagnosed as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and were either hospitalized or tested on outpatient basis.  Eligible participants were followed up telephonically after four weeks of diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical history, vaccination history, Cycle threshold (Ct) values during diagnosis and other variables. Characteristic of Long COVID were elicited, and multivariable logistic regression was done to find the predictors of Long COVID. \nResults: We have analyzed 487 individual data with a median follow-up of 44 days (Inter quartile range (IQR): 39,47). Overall, Long COVID was reported by 29.2% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 25.3%,33.4%) participants. Prevalence of Long COVID among patients with mild/moderate disease (n = 415) was 23.4% (95% CI: 19.5%,27.7%) as compared to 62.5% (95% CI: 50.7%,73%) in severe/critical cases(n=72). The most common Long COVID symptom was fatigue (64.8%) followed by cough (32.4%). Statistically significant predictors of Long COVID were - Pre-existing medical conditions (Adjusted Odds ratio (aOR)=2.00, 95% CI: 1.16,3.44), having a more significant number of symptoms during acute phase of COVID-19 disease (aOR=11.24, 95% CI: 4.00,31.51), two doses of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.17,4.58), the severity of illness (aOR=5.71, 95% CI: 3.00,10.89) and being admitted to hospital (Odds ratio (OR)=3.89, 95% CI: 2.49,6.08).\nConclusion: A considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases reported Long COVID symptoms. More research is needed in Long COVID to objectively assess the symptoms and find the biological and radiological markers.</p>',

        abstract: '<p>Multiple studies across global populations have established the primary symptoms characterising COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) and long COVID. However, as symptoms may also occur in the absence of COVID-19, a lack of appropriate controls has often meant that specificity of symptoms to acute COVID-19 or long COVID, and the extent and length of time for which they are elevated after COVID-19, could not be examined. We analysed individual symptom prevalences and characterised patterns of COVID-19 and long COVID symptoms across nine UK longitudinal studies, totalling over 42,000 participants. Conducting latent class analyses separately in three groups (9no COVID-199, 9COVID-19 in last 12 weeks9, 9COVID-19 &gt; 12 weeks ago9), the data did not support the presence of more than two distinct symptom patterns, representing high and low symptom burden, in each group. Comparing the high symptom burden classes between the 9COVID-19 in last 12 week,9 and 9no COVID-199 groups we identified symptoms characteristic of acute COVID-19, including loss of taste and smell, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath and muscle pains or aches. Comparing the high symptom burden classes between the 9COVID-19 &gt; 12 weeks ago9 and 9no COVID-199 groups we identified symptoms characteristic of long COVID, including fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain or aches, difficulty concentrating and chest tightness. The identified symptom patterns among individuals with COVID-19 &gt; 12 weeks ago were strongly associated with self-reported length of time unable to function as normal due to COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting that the symptom pattern identified corresponds to long COVID. Building the evidence base regarding typical long COVID symptoms will improve diagnosis of this condition and the ability to elicit underlying biological mechanisms, leading to better patient access to treatment and services.</p>',

Information on willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms, take COVID-19 test and possible predictors were collected. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics evaluated at 5% significance level.\n\nResults: Mean age of respondents was 35.8 (S.D: 10.7) years and 57.0% were males. Majority (85.8% and 86.2% respectively) were willing to disclose COVID-19 symptoms and take COVID-19 test. Self-risk perception of contracting COVID-19 predicted both willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=3.236; 95%CI=1.836-5.704) and take COVID-19 test (aOR=3.174; 95%CI=1.570-6.419). Willingness to disclose COVID-19 symptoms (aOR=13.060; 95%CI= 6.253-27.276), knowledge of someone who had taken the test (aOR= 4.106; 95%CI= 1.179-14.299) and thought that it was important for people to know their COVID-19 status (aOR=3.123; 95%CI= 1.516-6.434) also predicted willingness to take COVID-19 test. \n\nConclusion: Nigerians are willing to disclose symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and take the COVID-19 test. Investment in interventions developed based on the predicting factors will help speed up the finding and testing of suspected COVID-19 cases.</p>',

However, information is lacking on symptoms that persist after recovery from COVID-19. In this study we assessed symptoms that persisted in patients even after their recovery and discharged from the hospital after one month from COVID-19.\n\nMethods: This study is an observational cohort study. Participants in this study were enrolled between 30 to 40 days after recovery from COVID-19 of the age 18 years or higher, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 disease. Outcomes from post COVID-19 participants were elicited through questionnaire that consisted of three main parts beginning from subjects demographical data, depicting about the status of COVID-19 and other co-morbidities of the subject, and about post-COVID-19 symptoms and manifestations.\n\nResults: All subjects have reported some manifestation after recovery from COVID-19 whereas numerous symptoms and diseases were experienced by a great percentage of participants. Fatigue (56.25%), dyspnea (74.3%) and disturbed sleep (64.3%) were among the most common symptoms. However, more critical manifestations like renal failure and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by only a few percent of the subjects. Rating of worse physical and mental health after post-COVID recovery was also reported by subjects.  There was a strong relationship found in between the presence of other co-morbidities before infection like diabetes, hypertension and in disease severity after infection. A total of 280 patients were enrolled and 160 completed the survey.\n\nConclusions: Post COVID-19 sufferers often experience symptoms that cause a disturbance in their physical health, mental health and their respiratory status for several weeks even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, all subjects after recovering from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring programme for their symptoms and condition improvement.</p>',
