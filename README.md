## Workbench
Workbench is an experiment at organizing and synthesizing research artifacts with a literal workbench metaphor. It merges the freedom of a physical desktop with features to organize, make annotations, track progress, and other features to facilitate research.

Workbench is heavily inspired by [Bumptop](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/papers/aagarawala_CHI2006.pdf)
